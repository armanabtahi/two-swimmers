# two-swimmers
This is a Neural network on two swimmers interacting with each other.
Swimmers are either pushers (beta=10), pullers (beta=10) or neutral squirmers (beta=0). The deep Neural net has been trained on 18 million synthetic data. The code runs a window of two swimmers at default positions. The user can interactively change the position of swimmers and their orientations as well as their types. Once clicked start, the program calculates the trajectories of these two swimmers.
